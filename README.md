# fruits-360-cloud

This project was made as a part of my `Masters in Data Science` with Openclassrooms to deploy an image pre-processing model on the cloud using AWS and PySpark.
The project contains the following files:
- A presentation (in french) that explains the architecture of AWS, PySpark and steps to launch an EMR cluster.
- A jupyter notebook containing a PySpark script, that can either be run locally, or on an EMR cluster.
